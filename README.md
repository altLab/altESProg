# ESP8266 11-11-2016
Respositorio tem como objetivo a programação do chip da Expressif https://espressif.com/en/products designado por: ESP8266-12E, usando o firmware de interface web "ESP Easy" http://www.letscontrolit.com:

The ESP Easy firmware can be used to turn the ESP module into an easy multifunction sensor device for Home Automation solutions like Domoticz. Configuration of the ESP Easy is entirely web based, so once you've got the firmware loaded, you don't need any other tool besides a common web browser.

The ESP Easy firmware is currently at build R78 an looks stable enough for production purposes as long as it's being used as a sensor device.

ESP Easy also offers limited "low level" actuator functions but due to system instability, this could be less useful in real life applications. 
The ESP Easy supports several Home Automation controllers or web-services that collect sensor data.
